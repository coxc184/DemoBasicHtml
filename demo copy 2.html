    <p><em><b>The peach</b></em> (Prunus persica) is a deciduous tree that bears edible juicy fruits with various
        characteristics. <br> Most are simply called <em><b>peaches</b></em>, while the glossy-skinned, non-fuzzy
        varieties are called nectarines. Though from the same species, they are regarded commercially as different
        fruits.</p>
